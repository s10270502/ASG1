This project is about my Front End Development (FED) Project as a Polytechnic year 1 student studying IT.
The inspiration is from my side hustle as a events and F&B recruiter as I have hired close to 2000 part timers over a few years.

In this project, I have decided to create a fictional events manpower agency that provides services to clients.
As this is a B2B business, the website is catered for businesses to identify if this service suits their needs.
The idea is to bring across that the service provided is reputable and can be trusted.
