# FED_S10270502F_PierreFoo_Assg1_website
This project is about my Front End Development (FED) Project as a Polytechnic year 1 student studying IT.
The inspiration is from my side hustle as a events and F&B recruiter as I have hired close to 2000 part timers over a few years.


## Design Process
In this project, I have decided to create a fictional events manpower agency that provides services to clients.
As this is a B2B business, the website is catered for businesses to identify if this service suits their needs.
The idea is to bring across that the service provided is reputable and can be trusted.
